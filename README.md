                                      #**Telecom Data Analysis**

This project involves the analysis of telecom data, focusing on key metrics such as data usage, traffic patterns, and user engagement across different services like Gaming, YouTube, Netflix, Google, and Email. The goal is to uncover trends, correlations, and actionable insights that can support business decisions in the telecom industry.

                                    ##**Project Overview**
This analysis aims to understand the patterns in telecom data usage by examining the download (DL) and upload (UL) traffic for various services such as gaming, YouTube, Netflix, Google, and Email. By identifying correlations and trends, the goal is to provide actionable insights that can help optimize the network infrastructure, improve customer satisfaction, and drive business growth.

                                    ##**Data Description**
The data used in this analysis includes information about:

Gaming_DL: Download traffic from gaming services
Gaming_UL: Upload traffic from gaming services
YouTube_DL: Download traffic from YouTube
YouTube_UL: Upload traffic from YouTube
Netflix_DL: Download traffic from Netflix
Netflix_UL: Upload traffic from Netflix
Google_DL: Download traffic from Google services
Google_UL: Upload traffic from Google services
Email_DL: Download traffic from email services
Email_UL: Upload traffic from email services
Total_DL+UL: Combined download and upload traffic across all services
The data includes hourly or daily traffic volumes collected over a specified period.
 
                                        ##**Objective**
The primary objectives of this analysis are to:

Analyze the correlation between the different types of traffic and total data usage (DL + UL).
Identify patterns in data consumption for various services.
Evaluate the impact of gaming traffic on the overall network performance.
Provide insights for optimizing service offerings and improving network management.
                                          ##**Technologies Used**
Python: For data analysis and visualization.
Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
Matplotlib: For plotting graphs and visualizations.
Seaborn: For advanced data visualization.
scikit-learn: For statistical analysis and machine learning.
Streamlit: For building interactive dashboards.
                                          ##**Results and Insights**
Based on the analysis, the following insights were derived:-

Gaming Traffic Correlation:- The correlation between gaming download traffic and total DL+UL data was found to be very high (0.998), indicating a strong relationship.
YouTube and Netflix Traffic: Both YouTube and Netflix showed minimal correlation with total data usage, suggesting that these services have a lower impact on overall traffic in this dataset.
Google and Email Traffic: Google and Email traffic showed weak correlations with total data usage, which could point to less frequent usage or smaller data consumption.
                                           ##**Key Insights**
Gaming services contribute significantly to total data usage. Optimizing network performance for gaming could lead to improvements in overall traffic management.
Minimal impact from YouTube and Netflix: These services have lower correlation with total data usage and may not be the primary drivers of network load.
Focus on gaming and high-demand services: Investment in gaming-related services and infrastructure could be beneficial due to its high data consumption.
